title: Leetcode55 Jump Game I
tags: [Leetcode]
---
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
<!--excerpt-->

Example 1
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Example 2
```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jumplength is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

Approach:
We can use greedy algorithm to solve this question. The idea here is to think whether you can reach at the index ***n-1*** from a given index. At index ***i***, the maximum index you can reach is `i + nums[i]`. Therefore, if you are at index ***i***, and you find that you can reach at the position that beyonds ***n-1***, then you can definitely reach at the position ***n-1***.

Solution:
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxjump = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i>maxjump || maxjump>=(nums.size() - 1)) break;
            maxjump = max(maxjump, i + nums[i]);
        }
        return  maxjump>=(nums.size() - 1) ? true : false;
    }
};
```
