Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

<!--excerpt-->

For example:

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal 
part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

Solution:

```C++

class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (x == 1) return 1;
        double lastY = 0;
        double ret = 1;
        while (floor(ret) != floor(lastY)) {
            lastY = ret;
            ret = (ret - (ret*ret - x) / (2 * ret));
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```

Conclusion:
I have learned and reviewed several things from this question:
